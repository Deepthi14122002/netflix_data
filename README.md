**Netflix Data Analysis – README**

**What This Project Is About**

This project explores a dataset from Netflix to uncover interesting trends and patterns in the types of content available on the platform. I use Python to clean the data, analyze it, and visualize key insights like what kind of shows Netflix has, when they were added, and where they come from.

**Main Goal**:

To better understand the content Netflix offers — including trends by genre, country, year, and content type (movies vs. TV shows) — and prepare the data for future machine learning tasks.

**What’s Done in This Project**:

Loaded and cleaned the Netflix dataset

Checked for missing values and duplicates

Explored data by type (Movie/TV Show), genre, release year, country, and rating

Created visualizations like bar charts, line plots, pie charts, and heatmaps

Built a simple machine learning model to predict content type (optional)

**Tools & Libraries Used**:

Python

Pandas – for data handling

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for visualizations

Scikit-learn – for simple classification model (if applied)

**What You Need**:

The Netflix dataset (e.g., netflix1.csv)

The notebook: netflix_data.ipynb

Run it in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
